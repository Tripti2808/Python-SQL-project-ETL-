In this we were having an orders dataset where we used the python for basic cleaning like handling null values,renaming the column names,standardization, adding new columns and many more operationss.Then we onnected the python to database through mysql and pymysql and the updated/cleaned dataset was appended to the database provided in mysql where the orders table was already created and order_id contains primary key which means unique and not null values only.
After that we fetched the data in mysql and performed basic queries on the dataset using various aggregate functions, group by ,order by, cte and many more.
